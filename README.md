## The niceness challenge ðŸ™Œ

An app that gamifies how a group of people treat each other.  It's really fun!  My wife came up with the idea and our whole family played it on vacation.  It changed how we treated each other and was super fun.   

To begin with, we're aiming the app at families.  Later, we might also branch-out to work teams as a team-building game.

Being nice rocks.
